# Introversion
This app attempts to solve the problems faced by introverted people when they must make conversaton in daily life.  Based on anecdotal experience the computer science and coding industries attract some introverted people.  This is a fun app that helps introverts navigate awkward social environments. This app will generate jokes and news that will allow the user to engage in that dreadful small talk that makes some introverts uncomfortable.<br>

The app utilizes HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and two web based API's to provide jokes and current news stories. <br>
